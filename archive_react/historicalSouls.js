//  THE APPOINTED: AS ABOVE
//  historicalSouls.js — The souls of scripture, myth, and deep history
// ============================================================
//
//  DESIGN NOTE:
//  These are not bosses. These are not collectibles.
//  They are the most important conversations in the game.
//
//  Each soul is mid-ascent. They've been working through their own
//  trial for longer than the party has been running. They have
//  perspective that only comes from having already paid the full cost
//  of something and having had a very long time to sit with it.
//
//  They are found as "?" encounters in the Mountain — optional,
//  missable, and devastating when found.
//
//  Each soul develops across multiple encounters (multiple runs).
//  Early: still carrying the full weight.
//  Middle: lighter but not finished.
//  Late: something closer to peace.
//  Some will be gone before the game ends. That is its own grace.
